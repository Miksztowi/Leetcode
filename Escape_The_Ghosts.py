# You are playing a simplified Pacman game. You start at the point (0, 0),
# and your destination is (target[0], target[1]). There are several ghosts on the map,
# the i-th ghost starts at (ghosts[i][0], ghosts[i][1]).
# Each turn, you and all ghosts simultaneously *may* move in one of 4 cardinal directions: north, east, west, or south,
# going from the previous point to a new point 1 unit of distance away.
# You escape if and only if you can reach the target before any ghost reaches you
# (for any given moves the ghosts may take.)  If you reach any square (including the target)
# at the same time as a ghost, it doesn't count as an escape.
# Return True if and only if it is possible to escape.
# Example 1:
# Input:
# ghosts = [[1, 0], [0, 3]]
# target = [0, 1]
# Output: true
# Explanation:
# You can directly reach the destination (0, 1) at time 1, while the ghosts located at
# (1, 0) or (0, 3) have no way to catch up with you.
# Example 2:
# Input:
# ghosts = [[1, 0]]
# target = [2, 0]
# Output: false
# Explanation:
# You need to reach the destination (2, 0), but the ghost at (1, 0) lies between you and the destination.
# Example 3:
# Input:
# ghosts = [[2, 0]]
# target = [1, 0]
# Output: false
# Explanation:
# The ghost can reach the target at the same time as you.
# Note:
# All points have coordinates with absolute value <= 10000.
# The number of ghosts will not exceed 100.
